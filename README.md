### Running to Program

Make sure you have a relatviely recent version of Java installed.

From the command line, go to ReebGraphPairing/build

#### For the Merge Pairing Approach
> java -jar ReebGraphPairingMP.jar <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>

#### For the Pair and Propagate Approach
> java -jar ReebGraphPairingPPP.jar <file1> <file2> ... <fileN>

Both should provide the identical results, though Pair and Propagate should be faster in general.
